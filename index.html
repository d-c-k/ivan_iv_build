Probably first plundered by the Poles as war booty from Moscow, and thereafter claimed by the Swedes in Warsaw in 1655. The helmet features beautifully gilded <span id="btn1" class="text_btn">decorations.</span> The wording in Old Russian around the circumference of the helmet reveals who it used to belong to, that is, Tsar Ivan IV of Russia (1530-1584). Currently in the colletion of the Swedish Royal Armory (Livrustkammaren).</p><br><br><p>The Shishak</p><br><p>One of the most widely used types of helmets in eastern Europe from the 14th century onwards, the shishak had a <span id="btn2" class="text_btn">high top</span> in the form of a tube where the unit commander could insert a red pennon. The shishak could be covered, or fluted vertically or in a spiral. It was introduced to Russia by the Turks but may have had Hellenistic origins. It differed from the shelom and kolpak types of helmets, by having a very long pointed top (shish) ending in a sharp point. In some types, <span id="btn3" class="text_btn">the section between</span> the cylindrical lower ring and the spike was hemispherical and ribbed or fluted, while it was more conical in others. A barmitsa (chainmail protecting the neck, throat and face) was frequently attached to the lower edge. The shishak's shape was similar to the traditional onion-dome shape of Russian churches. It is formed from a rounded dome that, near the center, reverses its curve to rise sharply to a point.</p><br><br><p>Sources:</p><br><a href="https://livrustkammaren.se/en" target="_blank">The Royal Armoury</a><br><a href="https://sketchfab.com/TheRoyalArmoury" target="_blank">Sketchfab</a></div></div><canvas class="webgl"></canvas></body></html>
